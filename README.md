- **Two-Way Binding** – Syncing form input values with state.
- **Form Structure Best Practices** – Building clean and reusable form components.

### Form-Related Hooks
- **`useState()`** – Store and update form field values.
- **`useEffect()`** – Run actions based on form changes, validation, or submission.
- **`useRef()`** – Handle DOM-based form values in uncontrolled components.
- **Custom Hooks for Forms** – Build reusable input logic like `useForm`.

### Form Validation
- **Client-Side Validation** – Simple required checks, patterns, and custom rules.
- **Real-Time Validation** – Show errors while user types.
- **Submit-Time Validation** – Validate only when the form is submitted.
